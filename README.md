## About Course Project

Repo includes the following files:
=========================================

- README.md
Explains the analysis files

- Codebook.md
Contains all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information

- run_analysis.R
Contains actual code

run_analysis.R does following:
=========================================

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, adding meaningful column names to it
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
Loading dplyr library
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
